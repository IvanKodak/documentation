Dear Pelias user,

Hey there! :wave: You know how this used to be the place you could find the Pelias installation guide? 
Well it didn't really belong here and we had to move it to another place. :grimacing:

Please head over to [pelias/pelias/INSTALL.md](https://github.com/pelias/pelias/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to find it.
It can also be viewed on [pelias.io](http://pelias.io/install.html).

See you there!
